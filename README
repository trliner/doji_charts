This app was built as part of a Mendicant University exercise and doesn't do anything very useful.

SETUP STEPS:

* run 'rake' to setup log directory
* create localhost mysql database 'doji_development'
* create a 'config.rb' file similar to 'config/config.rb.example'
* run 'ruby script/import_quotes' to import stock quote data
* configure passenger
